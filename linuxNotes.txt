ipv4 config file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
ifdown eth0: take down network interface to change it
ifup eth0: bring interface back up and into service
service network restart: takes down ALL interfaces, re-reads all config files, restarts network
Address of DNS server request stored in /etc/resolv.conf
host: gives ip address of given URL
/etc/hosts: contains table of hostnames to IP addresses
/etc/resolv.conf: contains IP addresses of the name servers the system consults when resolving names to IP addresses. Often DNS servers. Can contain other keywords that affect resolution.
/etc/nsswitch.conf: can be used to modify where hostname lookups occur. Has an entry that gives the order name that name resolution sources are consulted

Process of consulting when a connection is requested:
	/etc/nsswitch.conf is consulted to get the order of file consulting
	system consults first option (like /etc/hosts) and moves to next option if resolution fails (like moving to DNS)
	if /etc/hosts fails to resolve the name it moves to /etc/resolv.conf to access the configured DNS server entries which are queried in order. Once the request is resolved its returned to the system and placed in DNS cache for a time

ifconfig: interface configuration used to display network config info
	inet addr: primary network device IP
	UP means the device is active
	lo device: loopback device used by system when sending network based data to itself

ip [options] OBJECT COMMAND: deprecating ifconfig
	ip addr show: similar output to ipconfig
	ip route show: deprecating route
route: view table showing where network packages are sent
	-n: gives data numerically
ping: determine if given machine is reachable
	-c: specify how many times to ping (endless if not given)
	if pinging a hostname fails check its actual IP to see if name resolution is an issue
netstat: display network info similar to route
	-i: gives network traffic info, IX-OK AND TX-ERR are important, high tx-err can mean problems on the network like overwhelming traffic
	-r: display routing info
	-tln: show open ports, 22 port
